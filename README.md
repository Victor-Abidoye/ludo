An interesting  dice game played between 2 to 4 players
At the beginning of the game, players choose their houses (color).
A number of two to four players are allowed to play the game
Each player take turns to roll 2 dice, with each dice having faces of 1 - 6
Players can only move their seed out of the home when a 6 is rolled on the dice
If a doule 6 is rolled, the current player is allowed to roll the dice again 
Seeds outside the house must be moved the number of boxes rolled by the dice
A kill is made when a player's seed moves to the same position (boxes) that contains an opponents seed
When a kill is made, the opponent's seed is sent back to the house and the current player's seed is put out of the board
A seed that goes round the board returns to its house colored row down to the middle box of the board.
When the seed reaches the middle of the board, the seed must be removed from the board
The first player to remove all his seeds from the board wins.
